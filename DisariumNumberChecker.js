// A number is called a Disarium number if the sum of the powers of its digits equals the sum of the number itself.
// The digits are powered to their positions in the number.
// Example - Input: 135, Output: true. 
// 135 is a Disarium number because it equals to 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 (each digit powered to the position in the number).
// Write a program to check if a number is a Disarium number or not.

checkDisarium = (num) => {

};

console.log(checkDisarium(135));
